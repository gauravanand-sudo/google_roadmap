To crack **Google-level DSA questions**, you need to master **patterns**, not just random problems.

Here's a **complete, exhaustive, and structured DSA Pattern Guide** that will help you go from beginner to Google-level expert — including **what to master, problem count, difficulty tiers, real-life interview usage, and must-do problems**.

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Strategy (How to Approach)

1. **Pattern First**: Ask yourself *"What is the underlying pattern?"*
2. **Draw**: Use whiteboard or notebook to visualize data flow.
3. **Dry Run**: Always dry run before coding.
4. **Optimal vs Naive**: First code brute force, then optimize.
5. **Write and Revise**: Don’t memorize solutions, write from scratch.
6. **Time yourself**: Google expects you to solve in \~30–40 mins.
